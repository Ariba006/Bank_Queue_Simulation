# Bank_Queue_Simulation
An event-driven simulation mimics system behavior by processing events in time order. Each actor (person/object) has a data object placed in an event queue. When its event occurs, the actor performs actionsâ€”changing states, affecting others, or scheduling future events for itself or other actors.
